	abstract = {Local and State governments share the responsibility for protecting their citizens from disasters, and for helping
them to recover when a disaster strikes. In some cases, a disaster is beyond the capabilities of the State and local
government to respond. In 1988, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5121-5206, was enacted to support State and local governments and their citizens when disasters overwhelm them. This law, as amended, establishes a process for requesting and obtaining a Presidential disaster declaration, defines the type and
scope of assistance available from the Federal government, and sets the conditions for obtaining that assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of the Emergency Preparedness and Response
Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with coordinating the response.
This paper explains the declaration process and provides an overview of the assistance available.},
