	abstract = {Local and State governments share the responsibility for protecting their citizens from disasters, and for helping
them to recover when a disaster strikes. In some cases, a disaster is beyond the capabilities of the State and local
government to respond. In 1988, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 5121-5206, was enacted to support State and local governments and their citizens when disasters overwhelm them. This law, as amended, establishes a process for requesting and obtaining a Presidential disaster declaration, defines the type and
scope of assistance available from the Federal government, and sets the conditions for obtaining that assistance. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), now part of the Emergency Preparedness and Response
Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security, is tasked with coordinating the response.
This paper explains the declaration process and provides an overview of the assistance available.},

	shorttitle = {Mean absolute error and root mean square error},
	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017EGUGA..19.3574B},
	abstract = {The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are two metrics that are often used interchangeably as measures of ocean forecast accuracy. Recent literature has debated which of these should be preferred though their conclusions have largely been based on empirical arguments. We note that in general, RM SE2 = M AE2 + V ARk [{\textbar}ɛ{\textbar}] PIC PIC such that RMSE includes both the MAE as well as additional information related to the variance (biased estimator) of the errors ɛ with sample size k. The greater sensitivity of RMSE to a small number of outliers is directly attributable to the variance of absolute error. Further statistical properties for both metrics are derived and compared based on the assumption that the errors are Gaussian. For an unbiased (or bias corrected) model both MAE and RMSE are shown to estimate the total error standard deviation to within a constant coefficient such that ° -- M AE ≈ 2/πRM SE PIC . Both metrics have comparable behaviour in response to model bias and asymptote to the model bias as the bias increases. MAE is shown to be an unbiased estimator while RMSE is a biased estimator. MAE also has a lower sample variance compared with RMSE indicating MAE is the most robust choice. For real-time applications where there is a likelihood of "bad" observations we recommend ° - ° ---° - π- -1- π- π- TESD = 2 M AE ± √k- 2 - 1 2M AE PIC as an unbiased estimator of the total error standard deviation with error estimates (one standard deviation) based on the sample variance and defined as a scaling of the MAE itself. A sample size (k) on the order of 90 and 9000 provides an error scaling of 10\% and 1\% respectively. Nonetheless if the model performance is being analysed using a large sample of delayed-mode quality controlled observations then RMSE might be preferred where the second moment sensitivity to large model errors is important. Alternatively for model intercomparisons the information might compactly represented by a graph with axes of MAE PIC and °V-ARk-[{\textbar}ɛ{\textbar}] PIC where radials from the origin represent RMSE PIC .},

	abstract = {Bagging and boosting are methods that generate a diverse ensemble of classiﬁers by manipulating the training data given to a “base” learning algorithm. Breiman has pointed out that they rely for their eﬀectiveness on the instability of the base learning algorithm. An alternative approach to generating an ensemble is to randomize the internal decisions made by the base algorithm. This general approach has been studied previously by Ali and Pazzani and by Dietterich and Kong. This paper compares the eﬀectiveness of randomization, bagging, and boosting for improving the performance of the decision-tree algorithm C4.5. The experiments show that in situations with little or no classiﬁcation noise, randomization is competitive with (and perhaps slightly superior to) bagging but not as accurate as boosting. In situations with substantial classiﬁcation noise, bagging is much better than boosting, and sometimes better than randomization.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	volume = {6},
	abstract = {During the past fifty years, federal disaster policy in the United States has been shaped by
an ongoing conflict between proponents who favor federal intervention following a disaster and
those who believe disaster response should be the responsibility of state and local governments
and charity. This article explores the existing federal disaster policy landscape within the United
States with a focus on the Stafford Act, the cultural and political forces that produced it, and how
the current system is ill equipped to aid in the response and recovery from major catastrophes.
The Stafford Act defines how federal disasters are declared, determines the types of assistance to
be provided by the federal government, and establishes cost sharing arrangements among federal,
state, and local governments. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) carries out
the provisions of the Stafford Act and distributes much of the assistance provided by the Act. With
the establishment of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the threat of domestic terrorism,
and large-scale natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina, the limits of the Stafford Act and FEMA
have been shown. We look at several areas where the shortcomings of the Stafford Act have
emerged and propose directions for reform.},
